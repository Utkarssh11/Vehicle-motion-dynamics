# 🚗 Vehicle Motion Dynamics

The Vehicle Motion Dynamics is a physics simulation created using p5.js, where users can build and interact with their own terrain while driving a car around it. This simulation utilizes Verlet integration, a technique for simulating physical systems without relying on physics engines.

## ⚙️ Verlet Integration

Verlet integration is a numerical method that calculates the position and velocity of objects based on their previous states and the forces acting upon them. It is particularly useful for simulating the behavior of particles connected by constraints or springs, as is the case in this terrain simulation.

## 🏞️ Building the Terrain

To build the terrain, users can create vertices that define the shape of the landscape. These vertices are connected by constraints to form a network of interconnected particles. By manipulating these particles, users can create hills, valleys, ramps, or any other desired shape.

## 🚙 Car Simulation

The car in the simulation is represented by a separate particle that interacts with the terrain. It moves according to the forces acting upon it, such as gravity and collision with the terrain. Users can control the car's movements using input, allowing them to drive it around the terrain.

## ✨ Realistic Interactions

The Verlet integration technique used in this simulation enables realistic and dynamic interactions between the car and the terrain. As the car moves, it responds to the contours of the terrain, adjusting its position and velocity accordingly.

## 🎯 Features

- Build custom terrains with interactive particle manipulation.
- Drive a car around the terrain and experience realistic interactions.
